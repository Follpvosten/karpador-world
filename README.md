# karpador-world
Trying to create a reproducible minetest server setup here. The key part are
the submodules in worldmods, where I just add all the mods I want my server
to have.

This repo also contains my server's [minetest.conf], as well as the script I
use to deploy this setup on Hetzner Cloud.

The git repo is BSD 2-Clause licensed, the submodules have their own licenses.
